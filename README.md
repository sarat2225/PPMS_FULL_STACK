# PPMS
This project is built using Flutter and Django.

## Description
The objective of this project is to develop an efficient and automated software platform, called PhD Progress Management System (PPMS), to manage the progress of research scholars pursuing their PhDs at IIT. The system will automate various stages of a student's PhD journey, including student registration, guide selection, course registration, thesis submission, and final viva voce. Additionally, PPMS will maintain a comprehensive record of all students, their guides, ongoing projects, and funding details. The system will also provide timely reminders to students about upcoming events to streamline the PhD journey and ensure efficient progress management.The frontend of the application is built using Flutter and the backend is built using Django.

The frontend of the application allows users to interact with the application and perform certain actions such as login, register, and view certain information. The backend of the application provides the necessary API endpoints for the frontend to consume.
